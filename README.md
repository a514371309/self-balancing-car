# self-balancing-car
# The self-balancing car includes a MCU Arduino Leonardo, two step motors , two motor drivers A4899, a IMU sensor MPU-6050, a bluetooth
# module HC-06, and other neccessary parts.
# The balancing control is based on two PI control loops, I find a good introduction as the link http://www.instructables.com/id/Self
# -Balancing-Robot/, Sensor fusion (gyroscope + accelerometer to get the leaning angle) is performed by a Kalman filter, you may follow  # the # next link in order to get more knowledge file:///E:/Robotics/Arduino/self%20balancing%20car%20and%20raspberry%20pi%20camera

# I will post all the code including the arduino control code and app for bluetooth control(which unfortunately only works on Andriod OS # ).
